For an insurance company is a priority to supply customers with an easy and streamlined way to provide all the information needed when reporting a claim or asking for a quote. A simple and efficient process to do so improves customer experience, reduces human error and accelerates the information collection process. An accurate mileage reading is a key piece of information that is relevant for auto insurance quotes and claims processing. The vehicle mileage can be combined with the License Plate number and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to get a complete overview of the information needed for many insurance processes and workflows. The of this project would be to design a solution for extracting vehicle mileage from odometer images taken by mobile devices.
